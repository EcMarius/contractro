<h2>6. User Obligations</h2>

<p>Users agree to use the Service only for lawful and intended business purposes. You must not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resell or redistribute access to the platform or lead data</li>
<li>Use bots, scrapers, or automated methods to extract data from the platform beyond the provided features</li>
<li>Violate Reddit\'s Terms of Service or community guidelines when using the platform</li>
<li>Engage in spamming, harassment, or any abusive behavior on connected platforms</li>
<li>Use the Service for any illegal or fraudulent activities</li>
</ul>

<p>Violation of these obligations may result in suspension or termination of access without refund.</p>

<h2>7. Suspension and Termination</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the Service at our discretion if a user:</p>
<ul>
<li>Violates these Terms</li>
<li>Exceeds fair use limits</li>
<li>Engages in fraudulent or abusive behavior</li>
<li>Disrupts the functionality or integrity of the platform</li>
<li>Fails to pay subscription fees</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event of termination, all user access and data may be revoked or deleted, unless retention is required for legal or compliance purposes.</p>

<h2>8. Fair Use and Abuse Prevention</h2>

<p>To maintain platform integrity and prevent misuse, ContractRO enforces fair use limits across all plans to protect against excessive usage, abuse, or automated activity that could harm system performance.</p>

<p>Specific usage limits vary by subscription plan and are detailed in your account dashboard and plan documentation. These limits may include restrictions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of campaigns that can be created per day</li>
<li>AI-powered feature usage (keyword generation, reply suggestions, etc.)</li>
<li>API requests and automated operations</li>
<li>Data export frequency</li>
</ul>

<p>We reserve the right to temporarily block, throttle, or suspend usage that exceeds fair use limits or appears abusive.</p>

<p><strong>Inactive Accounts:</strong> Free plan users who have been inactive for extended periods may have their campaign syncs automatically paused. Syncing will automatically resume once the user logs back in.</p>

<h3>8.1 Manual Sync Usage Policy</h3>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Manual campaign syncs are counted towards your monthly manual sync limit at the moment you initiate the sync operation. This limit is consumed <strong>regardless of whether the sync completes successfully or is stopped mid-process</strong>.</p>

<p>When you click "Sync Now" or initiate a manual sync through the API:</p>
<ul>
<li>One (1) manual sync credit is immediately deducted from your monthly allowance</li>
<li>The sync operation begins processing in the background</li>
<li>If you stop the sync before completion, the manual sync credit is <strong>not refunded</strong></li>
<li>This policy prevents abuse and ensures fair resource allocation across all users</li>
</ul>

<p>Manual sync limits reset at the beginning of each billing cycle. Automated syncs (scheduled background syncs) do not count towards manual sync limits and are managed separately according to your plan\'s sync interval settings.</p>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This policy is necessary because initiating a sync consumes server resources, API quota from third-party platforms (Reddit, Twitter/X, etc.), and processing capacity - regardless of whether the operation completes. Stopping a sync mid-process does not eliminate these costs.</p>

<h2>9. Lead Data Retention</h2>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> ContractRO retains discovered leads in your account for <strong>60 days</strong>. After 60 days, lead records may be permanently deleted and may no longer be accessible.</p>

<p>You are responsible for exporting any data you wish to retain before the retention period ends. CSV export functionality is available in all paid plans.</p>

<h2>10. Data and Privacy</h2>

<p>ContractRO only collects and displays publicly available discussion data from Reddit. No private user data from third-party platforms is accessed or stored.</p>

<p>All user-provided data (campaign information, keywords, account details, etc.) is handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.</p>

<h2>11. AI Limitations and Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>

<p>ContractRO uses artificial intelligence to evaluate and rank public social media posts based on their potential relevance to a user\'s product or service.</p>

<p><strong>While the AI system is designed to surface high-intent or relevant posts, it may occasionally return false positives or miss qualified leads</strong> — especially if the input campaign description or keywords are unclear, vague, or overly broad.</p>

<p>Users are encouraged to regularly review and refine their campaigns to improve accuracy and results. We do not guarantee specific outcomes or lead quality.</p>

<h2>12. Third-Party Services Disclaimer</h2>

<p>ContractRO interacts with third-party services and APIs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reddit</strong> (for lead discovery and social media data)</li>
<li><strong>Stripe</strong> (for secure payment processing)</li>
<li><strong>Supabase</strong> (for data storage and management)</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI</strong> (for AI-powered features)</li>
</ul>

<p>While we strive to provide continuous integration with these services, we do not control their availability, functionality, or data accuracy.</p>

<p>Changes or outages on these platforms may affect certain features of ContractRO. We are not liable for service interruptions or limitations resulting from third-party platform issues beyond our control.</p>

<h2>13. Right of Withdrawal and Cancellation</h2>

<p>Users may cancel their subscription at any time from their account settings.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Trial cancellations:</strong> If you cancel during the 7-day free trial, you will not be charged</li>
<li><strong>After the trial converts to a paid subscription:</strong> Refunds are not issued for partial billing periods unless required by applicable law</li>
<li>Your access remains active until the end of the current billing period</li>
<li>Data may be deleted 30 days after account termination</li>
</ul>

<h2>14. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>ContractRO is not liable for actions taken by users based on leads surfaced by the Service. We do not guarantee the conversion or accuracy of any lead.</p>

<p><strong>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid in the 12 months preceding any claim.</p>

<p>Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their outreach — including AI-generated comments or messages — complies with the rules, guidelines, and terms of the platforms they use. We are not responsible for account suspensions, bans, or penalties resulting from user actions on third-party platforms.</p>

<h2>15. Modifications to Terms</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Users will be notified of material changes via email or platform notification. Continued use of the Service after changes have been made constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

<h2>16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>

<p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the <strong>European Union</strong> and applicable international regulations.</p>

<p>Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of ContractRO shall be resolved in accordance with EU consumer protection laws and dispute resolution mechanisms.</p>

<h2>17. Contact and Support</h2>
